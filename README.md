# NASA PROJECT

<p>This is a simple project to highlights that I am a backend engineer</p>

## REQUIREMENTS TO RUN PROJECT

<p>To run this project, you need to prepare several things.<br>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, you need to have node installed in your local machine</li>
<li>go to this project root folder and run 'npm isntall'</li>
<li>run 'npm run install-both'</li>

## REQUIREMENTS TO BUILD PROJECT

<p>Here are some explanations regarding on how to deploy this project and run it in the same port/server</p>
<ul>
<li>In our client (if we are using some framework [in this case is react]) we need to build our project first into a single folder that is optimised for production</li>
<li>run 'npm run build' in the client folder (this only works for windows, if youre on mac, do your research hehehe). the code will create a public folder in your server</li>
<li>then you can run 'npm run server' in the server</li>
<li>or perhaps you can go to root folder of the project and run 'npm run deploy'</li>

</ul>
